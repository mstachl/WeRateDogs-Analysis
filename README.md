# Act Report

## Background

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that enthusiastically rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. As of July 2021 WeRateDogs has over 9 million followers, 14k tweets and has received international media coverage. 

The popularity of the account and the volume of its recorded media makes it a perfect candidate to gain insights by data analysis.

## Methodology

As a basis 2000+ tweets were gathered between 2015 and 2017 and scraped from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. Basic tweet information was extended by use of the Tweepy API. Furthermore, Udacity provided the results of a neural net determining the breed of each dog based on its image.
Cleaning the dataset by excluding retweets, replies and non-dog-related tweets left me with approx. 1800 tweets remaining for analysis.
